# Resolving Cache Issues with the Cat Avatar

If you're not seeing the updated Cat Avatar in the Voice Chat mode, you may need to clear your browser's cache and restart the application. This document provides instructions on how to do that.

## Quick Solution

1. Visit [http://localhost:5173/clear-cache](http://localhost:5173/clear-cache) in your browser
2. Follow the instructions on that page to clear your cache and reload the application

## Manual Steps

### 1. Clear Your Browser Cache

#### Chrome

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- Check "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"

#### Firefox

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- Select "Everything" for the time range
- Check "Cache"
- Click "Clear Now"

#### Safari

- Go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced
- Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
- Go to Develop > Empty Caches

#### Edge

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
- Check "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear"

### 2. Hard Reload the Application

- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl+F5` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd+Shift+R`

### 3. Restart the Application Server

If clearing the cache and hard reloading doesn't work, try restarting the application server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (usually with Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then start it again
npm run dev
```

## Verifying the Update

When the Cat Avatar is working correctly, you should see:

1. The cat image displayed in the Voice Chat mode
2. The cat's eyes and mouth animated when the AI is speaking
3. Different facial expressions based on the emotional content of the AI's responses

## Technical Details

The Cat Avatar implementation uses:

1. HTML5 Canvas for drawing and animating the cat's facial features
2. Manual positioning of eyes and mouth for better control over the animation
3. Cache-busting techniques to ensure the latest version of the image is loaded

## Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems after following these steps, try:

1. Checking that the cat image is properly placed in `static/images/cat/cat.png`
2. Using a different browser
3. Checking the browser console for any errors (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
4. Making sure the application server is running properly
