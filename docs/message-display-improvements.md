# Message Display Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **Missing user messages** - Both user and bot messages now display properly
2. ✅ **Message width** - Changed from small fixed width to 70% max-width for better space usage
3. ✅ **Excessive whitespace** - Changed container from fixed `h-96` to `h-full` with reduced padding
4. ✅ **No visual distinction** - Added proper alignment and styling for dialogue format
5. ✅ **Message bubbles** - Added rounded corners with sharp "speaking side" corners

## Changes Made

### 1. MessageList Component (`src/lib/modules/chat/components/MessageList.svelte`)

**Fixed dialogue display:**

- Added support for both `'user'` and `MESSAGE_TYPES.USER` to handle messages loaded from database
- User messages now align to the right with amber background
- Bot/tutor/assistant messages align to the left with gray background
- System messages remain centered
- Fixed `shouldShowMessage` to handle both constant and string types

**Improved visual design:**

- Changed container from `h-96` to `h-full` for flexible height
- Reduced padding from `p-6` to `px-6 py-4` for less wasted space
- Changed max-width from `max-w-xs lg:max-w-md` to `max-w-[70%]` for better use of space
- Added `rounded-br-sm` to user messages (sharp corner on bottom-right)
- Added `rounded-bl-sm` to bot messages (sharp corner on bottom-left)
- Added `shadow-sm` for subtle depth
- Reduced spacing from `mb-4` to `mb-3` between messages for tighter layout
- Added `leading-relaxed` and `whitespace-pre-wrap` for better text readability
- Improved timestamp and provider info opacity for less visual clutter

### 2. Sessions Page (`src/routes/sessions/+page.svelte`)

**Fixed message loading:**

- Ensured `user` type messages are preserved when loading from database
- Added metadata field to loaded messages
- Used actual message ID from database instead of index

**Improved styling:**

- Added custom scrollbar styling for cleaner appearance
- Added support for `assistant` message type in CSS
- Better spacing and visual hierarchy

### 3. Utility Scripts

Created helper scripts for testing:

- `scripts/check-sessions.js` - View all sessions in database
- `scripts/check-messages.js` - View messages for a specific session
- `scripts/clear-sessions.js` - Delete all sessions for testing

## Result

Messages now display as a proper dialogue:

- **User messages**: Right-aligned, amber background, sharp bottom-right corner
- **Bot messages**: Left-aligned, gray background, sharp bottom-left corner
- **Both message types** are visible and properly formatted
- **Better space usage**: 70% max-width, flexible height, reduced padding
- **Cleaner appearance**: Subtle shadows, better text spacing, refined scrollbar
- **Modern chat interface**: Proper dialogue format with clear visual hierarchy
