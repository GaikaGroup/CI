# Catalogue UX Enhancement

This document describes the major UX improvements implemented for the subject catalogue system.

## Overview

The catalogue UX enhancement transforms the learning system into a more intuitive, user-friendly interface with improved navigation, enhanced subject management, and better user experience.

## Key Changes

### 1. Route Changes

- **Old**: `/learn` - Learning interface
- **New**: `/catalogue` - Subject catalogue interface
- **Redirect**: `/learn` now redirects to `/catalogue` for backward compatibility
- **Removed**: `/admin/subjects` route (obsolete)

### 2. Navigation Improvements

- Added "Catalogue" link in the main navigation header
- Added "My Subjects" dropdown for enrolled users
- Removed obsolete admin subjects link
- Updated mode toggle to work with catalogue system

### 3. Subject Tiles Enhancement

- **Shortened content**: More compact tile layout for better browsing
- **Edit icon**: Creator-only edit functionality directly from tiles
- **Join button**: Simplified "Join" button instead of separate "Learn"/"Assessment" buttons
- **Better accessibility**: Improved ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### 4. Subject Management

- **Full CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete subjects
- **Permission-based editing**: Only creators can edit their subjects
- **Form validation**: Comprehensive client and server-side validation

### 5. Agent Management System

- **Multi-agent support**: Configure multiple AI agents per subject
- **Orchestration agent**: Automatically created for subjects with 2+ agents
- **Agent instructions**: Detailed configuration for agent behavior
- **Communication styles**: Configurable tone, formality, and response length

### 6. Document Upload & RAG

- **File upload**: Support for TXT and PDF documents
- **Embedding pipeline**: Automatic processing and vector storage
- **RAG integration**: Agents use uploaded materials for context
- **Material management**: View, organize, and delete uploaded materials

### 7. Enhanced Chat Interface

- **Agent-powered responses**: Chat integrates with configured agents
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Coordinated responses from multiple agents
- **RAG-enhanced context**: Responses informed by uploaded materials
- **Agent identification**: Shows which agent(s) provided responses

### 8. User Enrollment System

- **Join functionality**: Users can enroll in subjects
- **Progress tracking**: Track lessons completed and assessments taken
- **My Subjects**: Dropdown showing enrolled subjects with progress
- **Enrollment status**: Active, completed, or dropped enrollments

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

- `SubjectEditMode.svelte` - Comprehensive subject editing interface
- `AgentManager.svelte` - Agent CRUD operations and configuration
- `DocumentUploader.svelte` - File upload with progress and validation
- `MySubjectsDropdown.svelte` - Navigation dropdown for enrolled subjects
- `EnhancedChatInterface.svelte` - Agent-integrated chat interface

### New Services

- `UserEnrollmentService.js` - Manages user subject enrollments
- `AgentCommunicationService.js` - Handles agent-student communication
- Enhanced `SubjectService.js` - Extended CRUD operations

### New Stores

- `enrollmentStore.js` - Reactive enrollment state management
- Enhanced `adminStore.js` - Admin dashboard functionality

### Utilities

- `performance.js` - Performance optimization utilities
- `accessibility.js` - Accessibility helper functions

## Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side

- **Debounced search**: Reduces API calls during search
- **Lazy loading**: Images and components load on demand
- **Virtual scrolling**: Efficient rendering of large subject lists
- **Memoization**: Cached expensive computations

### Accessibility Improvements

- **Screen reader support**: Comprehensive ARIA labels and live regions
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Focus management**: Proper focus trapping in modals
- **Color contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color schemes
- **Reduced motion**: Respects user motion preferences

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Component rendering and interaction tests
- Service logic and validation tests
- Store state management tests

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end user workflows
- Agent communication flows
- File upload and processing

### E2E Tests

- Complete user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

## Migration Guide

### For Users

1. Existing `/learn` bookmarks will redirect to `/catalogue`
2. All existing subjects and data remain unchanged
3. New "My Subjects" dropdown shows enrolled subjects

### For Developers

1. Update any hardcoded `/learn` references to `/catalogue`
2. Use `EnhancedChatInterface` for agent-powered chat
3. Import new services and stores as needed

### Breaking Changes

- `/admin/subjects` route removed (use main admin dashboard)
- `ChatInterface` replaced with `EnhancedChatInterface` in catalogue context
- Mode toggle now uses 'catalogue' instead of 'learn' mode

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Advanced search and filtering
- Subject categories and tags
- User reviews and ratings
- Social learning features
- Mobile app integration

### Performance Improvements

- Server-side rendering optimization
- CDN integration for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
