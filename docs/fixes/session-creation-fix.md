# Session Creation Fix

## Problem

Users were unable to create new sessions, receiving a "Failed to create new session" error.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a mode mapping problem:

1. The application has three modes: `fun`, `learn`, and `catalogue`
2. The sessions API only accepts `fun` and `learn` modes
3. The `getApiModeFromAppMode()` function maps `catalogue` â†’ `learn`
4. When in `learn` mode, the API requires a `courseId`
5. If a user had `catalogue` mode stored in localStorage but had no enrolled courses:
   - The mode would be mapped to `learn`
   - `getDefaultCourseId()` would return `null`
   - The API validation would fail with "Course ID is required for LEARN mode sessions"

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Session Creation Logic (`src/routes/sessions/+page.svelte`)

Added logic to detect when `learn` mode is requested but no courses are available, and automatically fall back to `fun` mode:

```javascript
// Determine the actual mode to use
// If current mode is 'learn' or 'catalogue' but no courses available, use 'fun' mode
let sessionMode = currentMode;
let sessionCourseId = null;

if (currentMode === 'learn' || currentMode === 'catalogue') {
  sessionCourseId = getDefaultCourseId();
  if (!sessionCourseId) {
    // No courses available, fall back to fun mode
    console.log('[Sessions] No courses available for learn mode, using fun mode instead');
    sessionMode = 'fun';
  } else {
    // Use learn mode with the course
    sessionMode = 'learn';
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Mode Display (`src/routes/sessions/+page.svelte`)

Ensured that `catalogue` mode is properly mapped to `learn` mode for display purposes:

```javascript
$: currentMode = $appMode === 'catalogue' ? 'learn' : $appMode;
```

### 3. Added Validation (`src/lib/components/CourseGroup.svelte`)

Added validation to prevent creating sessions for invalid courses (like the "ungrouped" pseudo-course):

```javascript
// Validate that we have a valid course ID
if (!course.id || course.id === 'ungrouped') {
  throw new Error('Cannot create session without a valid course');
}
```

### 4. Improved Error Messages (`src/routes/api/sessions/+server.js`)

Enhanced the error message to be more helpful:

```javascript
return json(
  {
    error:
      'Course ID is required for LEARN mode sessions. Please enroll in a course first or switch to FUN mode.'
  },
  { status: 400 }
);
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging (`src/routes/api/sessions/+server.js`)

Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose future issues:

```javascript
console.log('[POST /api/sessions] Request received');
console.log('[POST /api/sessions] locals.user:', locals.user);
console.log('[POST /api/sessions] User ID:', userId);
console.log('[POST /api/sessions] Request body:', body);
```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Test Fun Mode Session Creation:**
   - Navigate to `/sessions`
   - Ensure mode is set to "Fun Chat"
   - Click "New Chat" button
   - Should create a session successfully

2. **Test Learn Mode with Courses:**
   - Enroll in at least one course
   - Navigate to `/sessions`
   - Switch to "Learn Mode"
   - Click "New Chat" button
   - Should create a session successfully

3. **Test Learn Mode without Courses:**
   - Unenroll from all courses
   - Navigate to `/sessions`
   - Switch to "Learn Mode"
   - Click "New Chat" button
   - Should automatically create a Fun mode session (with console log)

4. **Test Catalogue Mode Fallback:**
   - Set localStorage `appMode` to `'catalogue'`
   - Navigate to `/sessions`
   - Click "New Chat" button
   - Should handle gracefully

## Files Modified

- `src/routes/sessions/+page.svelte` - Fixed session creation logic and mode mapping
- `src/lib/components/CourseGroup.svelte` - Added course validation
- `src/routes/api/sessions/+server.js` - Improved error messages and logging

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always validate that required dependencies (like courseId) are available before making API calls
2. Provide clear fallback behavior when requirements aren't met
3. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
4. Ensure error messages guide users toward solutions
