# Session Creation Fix - Missing Users in Database

## Problem

Users were unable to create new sessions, receiving a "Failed to create new session" error with a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Root Cause

The authentication system was working with cookies/localStorage, but the corresponding user records didn't exist in the database. When trying to create a session, the foreign key constraint on `Session.userId` failed because the user ID didn't exist in the `users` table.

## Solution

Created a script to add test users to the database with proper password hashing.

### Script Created: `scripts/create-test-users.js`

This script creates two test users:

- **Admin User**: AdminLogin / AdminPswd (type: admin)
- **Regular User**: UserLogin / UserPswd (type: regular)

The script uses `upsert` to either create new users or update existing ones, making it safe to run multiple times.

### Usage

```bash
# Run the script directly
node scripts/create-test-users.js

# Or use the npm script
npm run create-test-users
```

### What the Script Does

1. Hashes passwords using bcryptjs (same as the registration endpoint)
2. Creates/updates admin user with email "AdminLogin"
3. Creates/updates regular user with email "UserLogin"
4. Sets proper user types and activates accounts
5. Displays the created user IDs and credentials

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/create-test-users.js` - New script to create test users
- `package.json` - Added `create-test-users` script command
- `package.json` - Added `bcryptjs` and `jsonwebtoken` to dependencies

## Testing

After running the script:

1. **Logout** if currently logged in
2. **Login** with one of the test accounts:
   - AdminLogin / AdminPswd
   - UserLogin / UserPswd
3. **Navigate** to `/sessions`
4. **Click** "New Chat" button
5. **Verify** session is created successfully

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Always run the user creation script** after database resets
2. **Check user existence** before attempting operations that require user IDs
3. **Add better error messages** that indicate when a user doesn't exist
4. **Consider adding a database seed script** that runs automatically after migrations

## Related Issues

This fix also resolves:

- Authentication working but operations failing
- Foreign key constraint violations on user-related tables
- Silent failures in user-dependent operations

## Additional Notes

The demo authentication in `LocalAuthService.js` was checking for these exact credentials but only storing them in localStorage/cookies without creating database records. This created a mismatch between the authentication layer and the data layer.

The proper flow should be:

1. User authenticates â†’ JWT token created
2. JWT token contains user ID from database
3. All operations use this user ID
4. User ID exists in database, so foreign key constraints pass
