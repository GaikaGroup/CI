# Archived Status Files

This directory contains temporary status files, implementation summaries, and fix documentation that were created during development but are no longer needed in the root directory.

## What's Here

### Implementation Status Files

Files documenting the completion of specific features or fixes:

- `*_COMPLETE.md` - Feature completion confirmations
- `*_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summaries
- `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation details

### Fix Documentation

Documentation of specific bug fixes:

- `*_FIX.md` - Bug fix descriptions
- `BUGFIX_*.md` - Bug fix details

### Test and Verification Files

Temporary testing and verification documentation:

- `TEST_*.md` - Test instructions and results
- `*_CHECKLIST.md` - Verification checklists
- `FAILED_TESTS_*.md` - Test failure analysis

### Localization Files

### Configuration Files

Temporary configuration documentation:

- `OLLAMA_FINAL_CONFIG.md` - Ollama configuration notes
- `COMMAND_*.md` - Command-related changes

## Why Archived?

These files were useful during development but:

1. Document completed work that's now in the codebase
2. Are temporary status updates no longer needed
3. Clutter the root directory
4. Are superseded by more current documentation

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- **Root README.md** - Main project documentation
- **docs/features/** - Feature documentation
- **docs/guides/** - User guides
- **docs/implementation/** - Implementation details
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history

## Historical Value

These files are kept for:

- Historical reference
- Understanding past decisions
- Tracking project evolution
- Debugging if old issues resurface
