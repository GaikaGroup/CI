# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the voice chat user experience by introducing waiting phrases that the bot speaks while generating responses. Currently, users experience a 10-15 second silence while the AI generates responses, creating an awkward pause. This feature will add personality and engagement by having the bot speak contextual waiting phrases during response generation, making the interaction feel more natural and conversational.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a voice message THEN the system SHALL immediately select and speak a random waiting phrase
2. WHEN the waiting phrase finishes playing THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition to speaking the actual AI response
3. WHEN multiple waiting phrases are available THEN the system SHALL randomly select one to avoid repetition
4. WHEN the AI response is ready before the waiting phrase finishes THEN the system SHALL queue the response to play after the waiting phrase completes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the waiting phrases to feel natural and contextually appropriate, so that the conversation flow remains engaging and human-like.

4. WHEN the waiting phrase is played THEN it SHALL use the same voice and emotion system as regular responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the waiting phrases to be easily configurable and maintainable, so that I can update or expand the phrase collection without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load waiting phrases from a configurable data structure or file
2. WHEN phrases need to be updated THEN they SHALL be modifiable through a centralized configuration file that developers can edit
3. WHEN adding new phrases THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the random selection without requiring code changes
4. WHEN phrases are categorized by context THEN the system SHALL support different phrase sets for different scenarios
5. WHEN developers want to add phrases THEN they SHALL be able to upload or edit a configuration file containing phrase collections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a multilingual user, I want the waiting phrases to be spoken in my preferred language, so that the conversation feels natural and consistent with my language choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user speaks in a detected language THEN the system SHALL use waiting phrases in the same language if available
2. WHEN waiting phrases are not available in the user's language THEN the system SHALL use English phrases and translate them using the existing translation system
3. WHEN the system translates waiting phrases THEN it SHALL use the same translation tool already built into the product
4. WHEN phrases are configured THEN they SHALL support multiple language versions in the same configuration file or data structure
5. WHEN developers add multilingual phrases THEN they SHALL be able to define phrases for multiple languages in a single configuration file
6. WHEN selecting a waiting phrase THEN the system SHALL prioritize native language versions over translated ones

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the waiting phrases to integrate seamlessly with the existing voice features, so that the cat avatar animations and lip-sync continue to work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN transitioning from waiting phrase to response THEN the avatar animation SHALL continue smoothly
3. WHEN emotion detection occurs THEN it SHALL apply to both waiting phrases and responses
4. WHEN audio analysis runs THEN it SHALL work for both waiting phrases and AI responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the waiting phrases feature to be reliable and not interfere with normal voice chat functionality, so that my conversation experience is enhanced rather than disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria
