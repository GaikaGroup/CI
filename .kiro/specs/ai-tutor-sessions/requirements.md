# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive session management functionality to the AI Tutor application, allowing users to create, manage, and continue learning sessions with persistent conversation history. The system will provide a modern, intuitive interface for session discovery, organization, and continuation, supporting both Fun and Learn modes across multiple languages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to view all my previous learning sessions in an organized list, so that I can easily find and continue past conversations.

4. WHEN no sessions exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN sessions are displayed THEN the system SHALL sort them by most recent first

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to create new learning sessions, so that I can start fresh conversations on different topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "New Session" THEN the system SHALL create a new session with default settings
2. WHEN creating a new session THEN the system SHALL allow selection of Fun or Learn mode
3. WHEN creating a new session THEN the system SHALL detect or allow selection of the primary language

5. WHEN no session is selected THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder message encouraging session selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to engage in conversations within sessions, so that I can have meaningful learning interactions with the AI tutor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in a chat session THEN the system SHALL display the conversation history with proper message formatting
2. WHEN sending a message THEN the system SHALL add it to the conversation with timestamp
3. WHEN receiving AI responses THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate styling and audio playback option

5. WHEN typing a message THEN the system SHALL support multiline input and send on Enter (without Shift)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to manage my sessions, so that I can organize and maintain my learning history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a session in the list THEN the system SHALL provide access to session management options
2. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL allow editing of session titles
3. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL allow deletion of unwanted sessions
4. WHEN deleting a session THEN the system SHALL request confirmation before permanent removal
5. WHEN session management actions occur THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want sessions to support multimedia interactions, so that I can have rich learning experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in a chat session THEN the system SHALL provide options for voice input via microphone
2. WHEN in a chat session THEN the system SHALL provide options for image input
3. WHEN AI responses include audio THEN the system SHALL provide playback controls
4. WHEN using voice features THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing voice functionality
5. WHEN multimedia content is shared THEN the system SHALL store it as part of the session history

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a learner, I want session data to persist reliably in a scalable open-source database, so that my learning progress and conversations are saved securely and can be accessed from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL persist it to an open-source database that can handle 10,000+ users with 100+ sessions each
2. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL save them to the database immediately with proper indexing for fast retrieval
3. WHEN the application is accessed THEN the system SHALL restore all session data from the database efficiently
4. WHEN session settings change THEN the system SHALL update the stored session metadata in the database
5. WHEN sessions are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data from the database permanently
6. WHEN the database approaches capacity THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling without data loss
7. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and graceful error handling
8. WHEN querying sessions THEN the system SHALL support pagination and filtering for optimal performance
9. WHEN selecting database technology THEN the system SHALL use open-source solutions to avoid vendor lock-in and licensing costs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the session interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the session interface THEN the system SHALL be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
