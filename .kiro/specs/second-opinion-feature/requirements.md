# Requirements Document - Second Opinion Feature

## Introduction

The Second Opinion feature allows users to request an alternative response from a different LLM model for the same question or message. This enables users to compare different explanations, verify answers, and find the most suitable learning approach for their needs.

### User Interface Overview

When a user receives a response from the AI tutor, a "Get Second Opinion" button appears below the message. Clicking this button generates an alternative response from a different LLM model, which is displayed below the original response with distinct visual styling.

**Visual Flow**:

1. User asks a question
2. AI responds (e.g., using GPT-4)
3. User sees "Get Second Opinion" button below the response
4. User clicks the button
5. System generates alternative response (e.g., using Ollama/Llama)
6. Alternative response appears below original with clear labeling
7. User can compare both responses and provide feedback

## Glossary

- **Chat System**: The AI-powered tutoring interface that processes user messages and generates responses
- **LLM Provider**: A service that provides Large Language Model capabilities (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- **Primary Response**: The initial answer generated by the first LLM model
- **Second Opinion**: An alternative response generated by a different LLM model for the same user message
- **Message Context**: The conversation history and user message that provides context for generating responses
- **Model Selection**: The process of choosing which LLM model to use for generating a response
- **Session**: A continuous conversation between the user and the AI tutor

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Request Second Opinion

**User Story:** As a student, I want to request a second opinion on an AI response, so that I can get an alternative explanation or verify the answer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a response from the Chat System, THE Chat System SHALL display a "Get Second Opinion" button below or adjacent to the assistant's message
2. THE "Get Second Opinion" button SHALL be clearly visible and labeled, positioned alongside other message actions (such as feedback buttons)
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Get Second Opinion" button, THE Chat System SHALL generate a new response using a different LLM Provider than the one used for the Primary Response
4. WHEN generating a Second Opinion, THE Chat System SHALL use the same Message Context as the Primary Response
5. WHEN a Second Opinion is generated, THE Chat System SHALL display it alongside or below the Primary Response
6. THE Chat System SHALL indicate which LLM Provider was used for each response (Primary and Second Opinion)

### Requirement 2: Model Selection for Second Opinion

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to automatically select a different model for the second opinion, so that I get a genuinely alternative perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a model for Second Opinion, THE Chat System SHALL exclude the LLM Provider used for the Primary Response
2. IF multiple alternative LLM Providers are available, THE Chat System SHALL select one based on a configured priority or rotation strategy
3. IF only one LLM Provider is available, THE Chat System SHALL display an error message indicating that a second opinion cannot be generated
4. THE Chat System SHALL maintain a record of which LLM Provider was used for each response in the Session

### Requirement 3: Display and Compare Responses

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see both responses side-by-side or clearly distinguished, so that I can easily compare them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a Second Opinion, THE Chat System SHALL clearly label which response is the Primary Response and which is the Second Opinion
2. THE Chat System SHALL display the LLM Provider name or identifier for each response
3. THE Chat System SHALL maintain the visual distinction between Primary Response and Second Opinion throughout the Session
4. WHEN a user scrolls through the conversation history, THE Chat System SHALL preserve the association between Primary Responses and their corresponding Second Opinions

### Requirement 4: Multiple Second Opinions

**User Story:** As a student, I want to request additional opinions if more than two models are available, so that I can explore multiple perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF more than two LLM Providers are available, THE Chat System SHALL allow users to request additional opinions beyond the first Second Opinion
2. WHEN a user requests an additional opinion, THE Chat System SHALL use a different LLM Provider than any previously used for that message

4. WHEN all available LLM Providers have been used, THE Chat System SHALL disable or hide the "Get Second Opinion" action

### Requirement 5: Context Preservation

**User Story:** As a student, I want the second opinion to be based on the same context as the original response, so that the comparison is fair and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a Second Opinion, THE Chat System SHALL use the identical Message Context (conversation history and user message) as the Primary Response
2. THE Chat System SHALL use the same system prompt and course materials context for the Second Opinion as the Primary Response
3. THE Chat System SHALL NOT include the Primary Response in the context when generating the Second Opinion to ensure independent answers
4. THE Chat System SHALL preserve all relevant metadata (language, course, subject) when generating the Second Opinion

### Requirement 6: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a student, I want the second opinion to be generated quickly, so that my learning flow is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a Second Opinion, THE Chat System SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHILE generating a Second Opinion, THE Chat System SHALL display waiting phrases appropriate to the user's language
3. IF the Second Opinion generation takes longer than 30 seconds, THE Chat System SHALL display a message indicating the process is still ongoing
4. IF the Second Opinion generation fails, THE Chat System SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry

### Requirement 7: Voice Mode Support

**User Story:** As a student using voice mode, I want to request and hear a second opinion, so that I can use this feature without switching to text mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in voice mode, THE Chat System SHALL provide a voice command or button to request a Second Opinion
2. WHEN a Second Opinion is generated in voice mode, THE Chat System SHALL read it aloud using text-to-speech

4. WHEN switching between Primary Response and Second Opinion in voice mode, THE Chat System SHALL provide clear audio cues

### Requirement 8: Admin Configuration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure which models are available for second opinions, so that I can control the feature based on available resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat System SHALL provide an admin interface to enable or disable the Second Opinion feature
2. THE Chat System SHALL allow administrators to configure which LLM Providers are available for Second Opinions
3. THE Chat System SHALL allow administrators to set the priority order for selecting alternative models
4. THE Chat System SHALL allow administrators to configure the maximum number of opinions allowed per message

### Requirement 9: Analytics and Tracking

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to track how often students use the second opinion feature, so that I can understand its value and optimize model selection.
