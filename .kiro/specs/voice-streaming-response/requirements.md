# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the voice mode response mechanism from a "wait-then-speak" approach to a real-time streaming approach. Currently, the bot waits for the complete AI response before starting text-to-speech synthesis, causing 10-15 second delays that create an unnatural conversation flow. This enhancement will implement streaming response processing where text-to-speech begins as soon as the first chunks of AI response arrive, dramatically reducing perceived latency and creating a more natural, human-like conversation experience.

## Glossary

- **Voice_Bot**: The AI-powered conversational system that processes user voice input and generates spoken responses
- **Streaming_Response**: A response delivery mechanism where AI-generated text arrives in chunks rather than as a complete message
- **TTS_Engine**: Text-to-Speech synthesis system that converts text into spoken audio
- **Response_Buffer**: A queue system that manages incoming text chunks and coordinates their conversion to speech
- **Sentence_Boundary**: Natural breaking points in text (periods, question marks, exclamation points) where speech can be synthesized independently
- **Audio_Queue**: A sequential playback system that ensures smooth transitions between synthesized audio segments
- **Chunk**: A portion of the AI response text received from the streaming API

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaging in voice chat, I want the bot to start speaking as soon as possible, so that I don't experience long awkward silences while waiting for responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI begins generating a response, THE Voice_Bot SHALL start processing text for speech synthesis immediately upon receiving the first Chunk
2. WHEN a complete sentence is detected at a Sentence_Boundary, THE Voice_Bot SHALL synthesize that sentence into audio without waiting for the full response
3. WHEN the TTS_Engine completes synthesis of a sentence, THE Voice_Bot SHALL begin playback immediately while continuing to process subsequent chunks
4. WHEN comparing to the current implementation, THE Voice_Bot SHALL reduce the time-to-first-audio by at least 70 percent
5. WHEN multiple sentences are ready for synthesis, THE Voice_Bot SHALL queue them in the Audio_Queue to ensure sequential playback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot's speech to sound natural and continuous, so that I cannot tell the response is being generated in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between synthesized audio segments, THE Voice_Bot SHALL ensure seamless playback without audible gaps or clicks
2. WHEN the Response_Buffer receives new chunks, THE Voice_Bot SHALL maintain consistent voice characteristics across all segments
3. WHEN a sentence is incomplete, THE Voice_Bot SHALL wait for the Sentence_Boundary before synthesizing to avoid cutting off mid-thought
4. WHEN the audio playback speed varies, THE Voice_Bot SHALL normalize timing to maintain natural speech rhythm
5. WHEN emotion or tone changes occur mid-response, THE Voice_Bot SHALL apply consistent voice modulation across segment boundaries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cat avatar to animate naturally with the streaming speech, so that the visual experience matches the audio in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio playback begins for each segment, THE Voice_Bot SHALL trigger mouth animation synchronized with that segment's audio
2. WHEN transitioning between audio segments, THE Voice_Bot SHALL maintain continuous lip-sync animation without resetting to neutral position
3. WHEN the final audio segment completes, THE Voice_Bot SHALL return the avatar mouth to the neutral closed position
4. WHEN audio analysis detects phonemes, THE Voice_Bot SHALL update mouth shapes in real-time for each streaming segment
5. WHEN emotion detection occurs, THE Voice_Bot SHALL apply facial expressions consistently across all segments of the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming response system to handle interruptions gracefully, so that I can interrupt the bot at any point without causing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interrupts during streaming playback, THE Voice_Bot SHALL immediately stop all audio playback and clear the Audio_Queue
2. WHEN an interruption occurs, THE Voice_Bot SHALL cancel any pending TTS synthesis operations in the Response_Buffer
3. WHEN the streaming API is still sending chunks after interruption, THE Voice_Bot SHALL close the stream connection cleanly
4. WHEN resuming after interruption, THE Voice_Bot SHALL start a fresh streaming session without residual state from the previous response
5. IF the user requests continuation after interruption, THEN THE Voice_Bot SHALL re-stream the remaining portion of the interrupted response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming response to handle text properly regardless of language, so that sentence detection and synthesis work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting Sentence_Boundary markers in text chunks, THE Voice_Bot SHALL recognize standard punctuation patterns including periods, question marks, and exclamation points
2. WHEN processing text chunks, THE Voice_Bot SHALL treat all text as UTF-8 encoded strings without language-specific processing
3. WHEN passing text to the TTS_Engine, THE Voice_Bot SHALL send complete sentences as they are received from the stream
4. WHEN special characters or punctuation appear in chunks, THE Voice_Bot SHALL preserve them for accurate sentence boundary detection
5. WHEN incomplete sentences are buffered, THE Voice_Bot SHALL wait for the Sentence_Boundary before synthesis regardless of text language

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive monitoring and error handling for the streaming pipeline, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming begins, THE Voice_Bot SHALL log the initial connection establishment and first chunk arrival time
2. WHEN chunks are processed, THE Voice_Bot SHALL track metrics including chunk size, processing time, and synthesis latency
3. WHEN errors occur in the streaming pipeline, THE Voice_Bot SHALL log detailed error context including the failure point and recovery action taken
4. WHEN audio playback experiences gaps, THE Voice_Bot SHALL record timing information to identify buffering issues
5. WHEN the streaming session completes, THE Voice_Bot SHALL generate a summary report with total response time, chunk count, and audio segment count

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming system to handle failures gracefully, so that my conversation continues even when technical issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the streaming connection fails mid-response, THE Voice_Bot SHALL complete playback of already-synthesized audio segments
2. IF streaming cannot be established, THEN THE Voice_Bot SHALL fall back to the traditional wait-for-complete-response mode
3. WHEN synthesis of a text chunk fails, THE Voice_Bot SHALL log the error and continue processing subsequent chunks
4. WHEN errors occur, THE Voice_Bot SHALL provide user feedback through the existing error handling system
