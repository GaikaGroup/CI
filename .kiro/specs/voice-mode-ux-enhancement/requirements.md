# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user experience issues in the voice mode of the chat interface to make conversations more natural and human-like. The current implementation has stuttering problems during waiting phrases and lacks proper interruption handling, which breaks the natural flow of conversation. This enhancement will implement smooth voice transitions, proper mouth animation synchronization, and intelligent interruption management with multilingual support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaging in voice chat, I want the bot to speak smoothly without stuttering, so that the conversation feels natural and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot voices waiting phrases THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth audio playback without stuttering or audio artifacts
2. WHEN audio stuttering is detected THEN the system SHALL implement buffering mechanisms to prevent interruptions
3. WHEN waiting phrases are being voiced THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent audio quality throughout the entire phrase
4. WHEN the bot transitions between waiting phrases and actual responses THEN the system SHALL ensure seamless audio flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user watching the bot's avatar, I want the mouth animations to properly synchronize with speech, so that the visual experience matches the audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot completes voicing any phrase THEN the avatar SHALL close its mouth to the neutral position
2. WHEN the bot is speaking THEN the mouth animation SHALL accurately reflect the phonemes being voiced
3. WHEN waiting phrases end THEN the system SHALL NOT leave the mouth in an open position
4. WHEN audio playback stops THEN the avatar SHALL immediately return to the resting state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who wants to interrupt the bot during its response, I want the bot to stop speaking and acknowledge my interruption naturally, so that the conversation flows like a real human interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts speaking while the bot is voicing a response THEN the bot SHALL immediately stop its current speech
2. WHEN the bot is interrupted THEN the system SHALL detect the user's input language automatically
3. WHEN an interruption occurs THEN the bot SHALL respond with an appropriate acknowledgment phrase in the user's detected language
4. WHEN the bot acknowledges an interruption THEN it SHALL offer options to either continue the previous response or address the new input
5. WHEN the user chooses to continue the previous response THEN the bot SHALL resume from where it was interrupted
6. WHEN the user chooses to address new input THEN the bot SHALL abandon the previous response and process the new request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a multilingual user, I want interruption handling to work in my preferred language, so that the bot's responses feel natural regardless of which language I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interrupts in any supported language THEN the system SHALL detect the language of the interruption
2. WHEN responding to an interruption THEN the bot SHALL use the same language as the user's interrupting message
3. WHEN offering continuation options THEN all prompts SHALL be presented in the user's detected language
4. WHEN the system cannot detect the language THEN it SHALL default to the user's previously established language preference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice interaction to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the conversation remains smooth even when technical issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple interruptions occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without audio conflicts
2. WHEN network issues affect voice synthesis THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior
3. WHEN the user interrupts during waiting phrases THEN the system SHALL stop the waiting phrase and process the interruption
4. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and offer text-based alternatives
5. WHEN the bot is processing a long response THEN the system SHALL allow interruptions at natural speech boundaries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of voice interactions, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice stuttering occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the audio processing state
2. WHEN interruptions happen THEN the system SHALL track timing and context for analysis
3. WHEN language detection occurs THEN the system SHALL log confidence levels and detected languages
4. WHEN audio synthesis fails THEN the system SHALL capture error details for debugging
5. WHEN users experience voice issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to support teams
