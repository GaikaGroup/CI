# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the gaps identified in the test coverage analysis to bring the project into full compliance with testing-requirements.md. The goal is to establish comprehensive test infrastructure including coverage thresholds, smoke tests, regression test structure, and CI/CD integration.

## Glossary

- **Test_System**: The complete testing infrastructure including unit, integration, E2E, smoke, and regression tests
- **Coverage_Threshold**: Minimum percentage of code that must be covered by tests (80% for lines, functions, statements; 75% for branches)
- **Smoke_Test**: Basic tests that verify critical functionality after deployment
- **Regression_Test**: Tests created to prevent previously fixed bugs from reoccurring
- **CI_Pipeline**: Continuous Integration automated workflow that runs tests on every commit

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want coverage thresholds enforced automatically, so that code quality standards are maintained

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Test_System runs coverage analysis, THE Test_System SHALL enforce minimum thresholds of 80% for lines, 80% for functions, 75% for branches, and 80% for statements
2. WHEN coverage falls below any threshold, THE Test_System SHALL fail the test run with a clear error message
3. THE Test_System SHALL generate coverage reports in text, JSON, HTML, and JSON-summary formats
4. THE Test_System SHALL exclude node_modules, tests, build directories, and configuration files from coverage calculation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want smoke tests for critical functionality, so that deployment issues are caught immediately

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_System SHALL provide a health-check smoke test that verifies application startup
2. THE Test_System SHALL provide an API availability smoke test that verifies all critical endpoints respond
3. THE Test_System SHALL provide a database connection smoke test that verifies database connectivity
4. WHEN smoke tests are executed, THE Test_System SHALL complete all checks within 30 seconds
5. THE Test_System SHALL provide a dedicated npm script "test:smoke" for running smoke tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured approach to regression testing, so that fixed bugs don't reoccur

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_System SHALL provide a dedicated directory tests/unit/bugfixes for regression tests
2. THE Test_System SHALL provide documentation explaining how to add regression tests for bugs
3. WHEN a bug is fixed, THE Test_System SHALL require a corresponding regression test before the fix is merged
4. THE Test_System SHALL name regression tests using the pattern "issue-{number}.test.js" or descriptive bug names

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks that enforce quality standards, so that broken code never reaches the repository

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer attempts to commit code, THE Test_System SHALL run ESLint checks and block the commit if errors exist
2. WHEN a developer attempts to commit code, THE Test_System SHALL run Prettier format checks and block the commit if formatting is incorrect
3. WHEN a developer attempts to commit code, THE Test_System SHALL run all tests and block the commit if any test fails
4. WHEN a developer attempts to push code, THE Test_System SHALL run the full test suite including coverage checks
5. THE Test_System SHALL provide clear feedback messages when hooks block commits or pushes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want CI/CD pipelines that automatically verify code quality, so that only tested code reaches production

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL run code quality checks including lint and format verification
2. WHEN code is pushed to any branch, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL run all unit, integration, and E2E tests
3. WHEN tests complete, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL generate and upload coverage reports
4. WHEN coverage falls below thresholds, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL fail the build
5. WHEN a pull request is created, THE CI_Pipeline SHALL display test results and coverage metrics in the PR

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API endpoint test coverage, so that all endpoints are verified to work correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_System SHALL verify that every API endpoint has tests for successful scenarios (200/201 status codes)
2. THE Test_System SHALL verify that every API endpoint has tests for authentication failures (401 status code)
3. THE Test_System SHALL verify that every API endpoint has tests for authorization failures (403 status code)
4. THE Test_System SHALL verify that every API endpoint has tests for validation errors (400 status code)
5. THE Test_System SHALL verify that every API endpoint has tests for server errors (500 status code)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test execution time metrics, so that slow tests can be identified and optimized

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed, THE Test_System SHALL complete within 30 seconds
2. WHEN all tests (unit, integration, E2E) are executed, THE Test_System SHALL complete within 2 minutes
3. WHEN tests exceed time limits, THE Test_System SHALL report which test suites are slow
4. THE Test_System SHALL provide timing information for each test file in the output

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on testing practices, so that all team members follow consistent patterns

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_System SHALL provide a README in the tests/ directory explaining test structure and conventions
2. THE Test_System SHALL provide example tests demonstrating unit, integration, and E2E patterns
3. THE Test_System SHALL provide documentation on how to run different test suites
4. THE Test_System SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance for common test issues
