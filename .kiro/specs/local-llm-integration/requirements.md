# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements local Large Language Model (LLM) support for the AI tutor system, with OpenAI API serving as a fallback mechanism. The goal is to improve response speed, reduce API costs, maintain privacy, and provide offline capabilities while ensuring reliable service through fallback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI tutor to respond using a local LLM for faster responses and better privacy, so that I can have more responsive conversations without relying entirely on external APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL attempt to generate a response using the local LLM first
2. WHEN the local LLM is available and functioning THEN the system SHALL use it for response generation
3. WHEN the local LLM response is generated successfully THEN the system SHALL return the response without using OpenAI API
4. WHEN the local LLM is unavailable or fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to OpenAI API
5. WHEN using local LLM THEN the response time SHALL be faster than OpenAI API calls
6. WHEN using local LLM THEN user data SHALL remain on the local system for privacy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which local LLM to use and set fallback preferences, so that I can optimize the system for my specific hardware and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to specify the local LLM model to use
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set fallback timeout thresholds
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to enable/disable local LLM usage
4. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
5. WHEN the configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log errors and use fallback mode
6. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate the local LLM configuration and availability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the local LLM integration to be seamless with existing chat functionality, so that the change is transparent to users and doesn't break existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating local LLM THEN all existing chat features SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN switching between local LLM and OpenAI THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN using either LLM provider THEN the response format SHALL be identical
4. WHEN voice chat is active THEN local LLM responses SHALL work with TTS synthesis
5. WHEN multilingual conversations occur THEN local LLM SHALL support the same languages as OpenAI fallback
6. WHEN image analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL handle multimodal inputs appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to know which LLM provider is being used for transparency, so that I can understand the source of responses and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a response is generated THEN the system SHALL log which provider was used (local LLM or OpenAI)
2. WHEN the system falls back to OpenAI THEN it SHALL log the reason for fallback
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL display provider information in the UI
4. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN metrics SHALL be available for both providers
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN logs SHALL clearly indicate the provider and any errors
6. WHEN the local LLM is unavailable THEN users SHALL be notified appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that the system remains reliable even when the local LLM encounters issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local LLM fails to start THEN the system SHALL automatically use OpenAI API
2. WHEN the local LLM times out THEN the system SHALL fallback to OpenAI within a reasonable time
3. WHEN the local LLM produces invalid responses THEN the system SHALL retry with OpenAI
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue using local LLM if available
5. WHEN both providers fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the system to optimize resource usage and response times, so that the AI tutor performs efficiently on my hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using local LLM THEN memory usage SHALL be monitored and managed efficiently
2. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL balance between local LLM and OpenAI based on performance
3. WHEN local LLM is slow THEN the system SHALL have configurable timeout thresholds
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to OpenAI fallback
6. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include response times, success rates, and resource usage
