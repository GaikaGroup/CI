# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for redesigning the course detail page (`/learn/[courseId]`) to provide a more engaging, informative, and visually appealing user experience. The current page has a minimal design focused primarily on the chat interface. The new design will feature a modern landing page layout with comprehensive course information, instructor profiles, learning outcomes, and an enhanced visual hierarchy before users start learning.

The redesign aims to:

- Provide better course overview and context before starting
- Showcase course instructors (AI agents) with detailed profiles
- Display learning outcomes and skills clearly
- Create a more engaging first impression
- Maintain the existing chat functionality for enrolled users
