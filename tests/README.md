# Voice Waiting Phrases - Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Voice Waiting Phrases feature, covering integration with existing systems and end-to-end user experience validation.

## Test Structure

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/chat/`)

#### `systemIntegration.test.js`

- **Cat Avatar Integration**: Tests animation synchronization, emotion handling, and lip-sync during waiting phrases
- **Voice Chat Features Integration**: Tests complete voice flow, audio queue management, and interruption handling
- **Multilingual i18n Integration**: Tests UI translations, language consistency, and translation fallback
- **Error Handling Integration**: Tests graceful degradation when components fail
- **Performance Integration**: Tests response times and memory efficiency

#### `catAvatarIntegration.test.js`

- **Lip-Sync Integration**: Tests mouth movement synchronization with audio amplitude
- **Emotion Integration**: Tests emotion state maintenance during waiting phrases
- **Animation Continuity**: Tests smooth transitions between waiting phrases and AI responses
- **Performance and Memory**: Tests resource cleanup and multiple avatar instances

#### `multilingualIntegration.test.js`

- **UI Language Integration**: Tests UI element translations in multiple languages
- **Waiting Phrase Language Selection**: Tests phrase selection in user's preferred language
- **Translation Fallback Integration**: Tests fallback to translation service for unsupported languages
- **Language Consistency**: Tests consistent language use throughout conversations
- **Performance and Caching**: Tests efficient handling of multiple languages and translation caching

### End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)

#### `voiceChatFlow.test.js`

- **Complete Voice Interaction Flow**: Tests entire user journey from voice input to AI response
- **Error Scenarios and Recovery**: Tests handling of transcription, AI response, and synthesis failures
- **Performance Validation**: Tests response times and concurrent interactions
- **User Experience Validation**: Tests visual feedback and UI responsiveness

#### `userExperienceValidation.test.js`

- **Silence Elimination**: Tests elimination of awkward silence during AI processing
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Tests conversation rhythm and phrase variety
- **Visual and Audio Feedback**: Tests status indicators and avatar integration
- **Accessibility and Usability**: Tests keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- **Performance Impact Validation**: Tests that waiting phrases don't significantly impact performance

## Test Configuration

### `vitest.config.js`

- Configures Vitest with SvelteKit integration
- Sets up jsdom environment for browser API simulation
- Configures test timeouts and coverage reporting
- Sets up module path aliases

### `tests/setup.js`

- Mocks browser APIs (AudioContext, MediaRecorder, etc.)
- Configures global test utilities
- Sets up cleanup procedures for consistent test state

## Key Test Scenarios

### Happy Path

1. User starts recording → stops recording → transcription → waiting phrase plays → AI response generated → response synthesized and played
2. Multiple consecutive interactions with phrase variety
3. Multilingual interactions with proper language detection

### Error Handling

1. Transcription service failure → graceful fallback
2. Waiting phrase synthesis failure → continue with AI response
3. AI response generation failure → proper error handling
4. Network connectivity issues → appropriate user feedback

### Edge Cases

1. Very fast AI responses (shorter than waiting phrase)
2. Very slow AI responses (multiple waiting phrases)
3. User interruptions during waiting phrase playback
4. Rapid consecutive interactions
5. Language switching mid-conversation

## Mock Strategy

### Browser APIs

- AudioContext and Web Audio API
- MediaRecorder and getUserMedia
- Audio playback and synthesis
- Image loading and manipulation

### External Services

- Transcription API responses
- AI chat API responses
- Text-to-speech synthesis
- Translation services

### Component Integration

- Svelte component rendering
- Store subscriptions and updates
- Event handling and user interactions
- Animation and timing systems

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets

- Complete voice interaction: < 8 seconds
- Waiting phrase selection: < 100ms
- UI state transitions: < 200ms
- Avatar animation updates: 60fps target

### Memory Usage

- Phrase history limited to 5 items
- Translation cache with reasonable limits
- Proper cleanup of audio resources
- No memory leaks during extended use

## Accessibility Testing

### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements focusable
- Proper tab order maintained
- Keyboard shortcuts functional

### Screen Reader Support

- Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Status updates announced appropriately
- Error messages accessible

### Visual Indicators

- Clear visual feedback for all states
- High contrast status indicators
- Animation respects user preferences

## Future Test Enhancements

### Potential Additions

- Visual regression testing for avatar animations
- Audio quality testing for synthesized phrases
- Load testing with multiple concurrent users
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing

### Automation Opportunities
